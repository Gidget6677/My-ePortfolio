        <article>
            <p> My name is Bridget. Chenjerai. I am a first-generation Australian bilingual immigrant daughter who came here from Zimbabwe when I was seven. This is something that has really shaped me into who I am from personal beliefs, work ethic to social relationships. At the same time this is not something I realised would affect me all that much till after high school when I finally realised that a lot of people were relying on my success, and I started helping my mother with bills and sending money overseas. As result of me not realising this till later in life I really squandered my high school education which has resulted in me taking any educational opportunity handed to me from doing my certificate 3 In individual support offered to me by my previous work and applying for the free CS50 course offered by Harvard, which I am currently working on, on the side. Which is something I would say goes along with what you would call a normal hobby what I mean is I love collecting different hobbies from crocheting, to sewing and in doing so I will buy everything I need for the hobbies and get about beginner level skills before getting bored and stopping.</p>

              <div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Intrest in IT</h1></div>

              <h3>Describe your intrest in IT?</h3>
              <div class="sectionContent">
                <article>
                  <p>Honestly before all of this I never really had an interest in IT specifically and to say so would be a lie and at the same time I have never really had an interest in any job specifically because I just knew that the expectation for me was either to be a doctor, engineer, or lawyer. This is a result the fact I am first generation immigrant all that really mattered was that I had a high paying job to help my family.SO when I started doing the Harvard Cs50 course during my free time and started enjoying it which resulted in me researching the field and I a saw how high paying the IT field is, I guess is when my interest was piqued.</p>

                <h3>Why did I choose RMIT</h3>
                <p>When it came to choosing what university to go to, I did not have many options on which one to go to without having to take an alternative pathway because early on I did not take my high school education seriously enough. So when I was researching ways to get into the IT field I decided to go on to open university where I discovered I could take two university subjects through RMIT which if I passed I could use to get into my university of choice and do a credit transfer without having to spend 6 months doing an alterative pathway course and instead learning the skills for my chosen field and order to complete my degree faster and allowing me to also have more background knowledge.</p>

                <h3>What do I exepct to learn during my studies?</h3>
                <p>During my studies I expect to learn fundamental skills that every student needs that I will help me to succeed further in my studies to complete my university degree with less frustration which hopefully will allow me to get a good job in the future. In addition, I hope it will also allow to me to better develop my communication and teamwork skills as well which I then will be able to use during my further studies or just in everyday life.</p>

                <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
                <p>As of the moment my plans for me to be able to reach my future goals is to take as many learning opportunities that are presented to me in order to boost my skill, knowledge and experience this will be in the form of taking the many summers and long-term internships/ and graduate programs that are offered on websites such as gradconnect, seek and gradAustralia. In addition, I also plan to boost my skills for the position or any position if I change my mind down the line about my job choice by taking additional studies and courses that are widely available. On top of gaining any extra courses or qualifications I will also keep in mind to add to my portfolio by completing side projects to practically display my skills to a future employee because it is about getting a degree or qualification it is also about being abo=le to properly apply the skills taught to me.</p>

                <h3>Results and what they mean to me</h3>
                <img src="Personality1.PNG" alt="Myers-Briggs_test results" /><img src="5 big factors.PNG" alt="5 big factor reults" />
                <p>The results provided to me don’t necessarily mean that that much to me personally because I believe the predications provided to me by the test can’t pre-determine how I or anyone else will perform at our jobs in the long run, in addition they also can’t determine someone’s happiness in a specific situation or ability to work in a team dynamic based just on how an individual’s personality type interact with an opposing personality type. Which is why I don’t think these tests
                should be used for determining how and who we interact with but rather for self-reflection into one’s own conscious understanding of who they are as an individual and get a better understanding of the actions and decisions they make every day in order to better understand on a deeper level why certain methods of studying work or don’t work for them or why they can’t cant work with a specific individual other than just our personality tests don’t match. </p>
                <h3>Influance of results on my behaviour</h3>
                <p>As stated above I do not believe that these tests should be used to determine how you will act and the decisions you will make in certain situations but should be used for self-reflection into your own behaviour. Which is why when the tests asserts that I am an ISFP-T personality type suggesting I am more of an introverted individual who struggles with rules and structure and often lacks communication. When this comes to self-reflection and my behaviour in my team it means I will take care to be more aware that I’m properly communicating with my team when it comes to my struggles and any ideas rather than aiming to be independent and showing what I can do because it won’t be just about me but also my team. Additionally Ill attempt to be less introverted and put effort into getting to know my team members and get to know them because I can be quite shy which is something I knew before taking the test. Also, when it comes to the learning style test Ill take heed and attempt to reflect and learn from any mistakes and my team members because I do learn best in a group setting where we can discuss with each other and learn from one another.</p>
                <h3>How should I take this into account in a team format</h3>
                <p>When it comes to forming a team there a lot of factors that can contribute to whether the team is successful or not. When you are looking for group members, you are looking for a well-balanced team that can work with each other’s strengths and weakness and that’s able to up lift each group member. SO, when it comes to incorporating the results of the tests you want to make sure that my team isn’t built on the similarity’s that me and my team members share such as looking for only introverts or only creative people because that is not how a well-balanced team is built. Take a basketball team where you will have people with different skill sets to fill various positions within the team such as the centre, the power forward and the point guard, all of whom provide different skills which are essential for the team to succeed. Which is why when it comes to choosing my team it will not be about making sure that we get along it will also be about making sure that we are also a well-rounded group who take each other’s weakness and strengths into account, I can do this by simply having a discussion which role we are all comfortable doing and what are struggles are. This way we can work together to balance the team by adjusting for each members skill set.</p>

            <div class="sectionTitle"><h2>Project Idea</h2></div>
              <div class="sectionContent">
                  <article>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The project I have chosen is a group travel app that will make it easier to plan a trip among friends or family which is something that can be made tricky when trying to figure out people’s individual budget limits, itinerary preferences, and everything else needed for a great a trip. This app is going to be designed to help keep everyone on the same page by organizing itineraries, expenses, and photos all on one app for everyone to see and provide input decreasing the chances of people cancelling out of frustration and guaranteeing an amazing trip for everyone involved. </p>

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                      <p>What inspired me to make this app was that recently I was asked to go on a road trip with a group of friends which I was excited to go to till I remember the numerous amounts of times where I have planned vacations with friends only for them to fall apart a week down the line for several different reasons. To try and prevent this I researched for apps that would assist us with planning the trip, but I couldn’t find any that would fit me, and my friends need.
                      While doing research for this I found that 85% of travellers use mobile devices to book travel activities. (Martech Zone, 2018) and more than not it’s several different apps all scattered around such as trivago and booking.com so I figured why not do all the things they can do but on one app. In addition, travel agent central found that 40% of individuals want to travel with friends but decide not to because of the difficulties involved in the task.</p>
                      <h3>Discription</h3>
                      <p>The app itself will have several different features and services ranging from allowing the users to suggest possible dates within the app and then all your mates can take a vote. The idea will be to use a poll feature at the end which would be a good way to decide fairly without anyone kicking off that they were left out.</p>
                      <p>The app will make sharing expenses simple. It will have an option where you can just fill in the costs (food, shopping, accommodation etc) and the app does the maths for you. Invite your group members who will be borrowing money into a group chat so they can log their own expenses and check out what others owe. Anything owed to you is highlighted in green with a (+) sign, and the money that you owe is highlighted in red with a (-). No more handing each other the same fiver back and forth until the end of time.</p>
                      <p> On top of that this app will also allow you to create polls for destinations and budget (and anything else you might need to vote on) rather than just dates. You can also easily gather everyone’s travel information – things like full names, dates of birth and allergies in one place. You can also get information like if a person has a passport and whether they can travel out of state.</p>
                      <p>Flight comparison is another feature that will be included on the app which will help users find cheap flights from their sofa, allowing everyone to communicate what they want, and they can and can’t afford and making sure that they are all on the same flight. Also, the app will allow the users to search destinations by budget and travel timeframe. This is a great way to find destinations you might never have thought of travelling to. You can set up reliable flight   alerts and can also compare hotels and car hire options all at the same time as well.
                      Another unique feature of the app will be a local culture snap section which will include short to in-depth travel guides for each destination that will focus on location-centred stories and activities </p>
                      <p>in different locations worldwide. In addition, I hope that the articles themselves will mostly be written by local experts who can really give the user a flavour for the place their going. I also plan to have an itinerary segment where the user can create their own individual itinerary for each location and locate restaurants, bars, pubs, and markets in a specific location.</p>
                      <p>Lastly the main feature that comes to mind will be an Activities section where you can find, compare, and book sightseeing tours, attractions, excursions, things to do and fun activities. It’s simple to use and clearly shows the highlights of each tour, and what exactly is included. Once you’ve selected your tour or activity, you can also set your budget for the activities and whether you want ones you can also book and pay in advance or pay when you get there.</p>

                      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                      <p>Firstly mobile user interface design is probably the most important skill of mobile app development ill need to learn as is building a high-quality user interface (UI). There are a number of ways to achieve this such as HTML or CSS and with the internet I could probably find websites or apps to assist with this
                      Primary elements of UI designing:</p>

                      <ul>
                      <li>Components are where the user is likely to expect them</li>
                      <li>Good use of a unified colour scheme</li>
                      <li>Fast loading and operation of the application</li>
                      <li>General help, basic tips and actions</li>
                      <li>Activity Indicators</li>

                      </ul>
                    <p> Secondly Cross-Platform App Development is another good skill To develop this idea, I will also eventually have to learn to use multiple operation platforms in the current industry. As far as market penetration, there are three major mobile platforms: Android, iPhone, and Windows Phones. Meaning I will have to be versatile enough to create the app across any platform for any device.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly back end commputing is another usful skill that would involve learning how to do another of things such as: Security, Database management, Hardware interaction and Implementation of memory allocation which is something l will need to learn for full stack development.</p>
                    <p>Lastly moderned programming skills are another important skill required to develop mobile applications is the knowledge of programming using modern programming languages.Altogether, programming may include several things:</p>

                      <ul>
                      <li>Experience with commonly used programming languages like C# and Java</li>
                      <li>The ability to use different languages like HTML 5 and CSS</li>
                      <li>I would need to Familiarize myself with mobile platform Application Programming Interfaces (API) such as Apple iOS, Android and Windows Mobile</li>
                      <li>Able to implement the use of cross-platform mobile suites like Antenna and AMP (Accounting-Management-Promotion).</li>
                      </ul>

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>The development of the app will allow more people to plan trips with friends and family with less fuss and miscommunications from having to use different apps and websites and then having to communicate the information on a different platform reduces decreasing the changes of people losing interest in the vacation itself and eventually cancel all together from the stress or people giving up on an amazing holiday from finding it too hard. Overall, the goal of the app is to reduce stress, add convenience, increase value, enhance the experience, and eliminate Risk of traveling and cancelation. </p>
